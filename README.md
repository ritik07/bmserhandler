# bmserhandler
It's an error/success message and code handler package which is used to give code and message against the API calls.
(e.g- 102: Record added successfully)
In turn, these codes and messages can be later used to show at frontend side and to track the validation error if any.

By this concept we can manage an unique and centralize error/success code and error/success message for our app.
